Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
On a jupiter and mars
in other words
hold my hand
in other words
baby kiss me
fill my heart with song
and let me sing forevermore
you are all i long for
all i worship and adore
in other words
please be true
in other words
i love you
shine
bright
like
a diamond
tonight
shine
bright like
a diamond
